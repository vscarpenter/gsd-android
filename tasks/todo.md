# GSD Android — progress

## Done
- **Phase 0** foundations · **Phase 1** core local app (`v0.1.0-phase1`) · **Phase 2** task depth
  (`v0.2.0-phase2`) · **Phase 3** organization & insight (`v0.3.0-phase3`) · **Phase 4**
  notifications (`v0.4.0-phase4`)
- **Phase 5 — sync** (`v0.5.0-phase5`): snake_case wire mapper with lossy time entries and
  device-local preservation; lenient PocketBase dates + 5 s cursor rewind; JWT payload decode;
  SSE frame parser + apply rules (echo filter, owner fail-closed, delete queue-protection);
  OkHttp PocketBase client (bare-JWT header, typed 429/401); the LWW SyncEngine passing the full
  §13.6 matrix (pull/push/reconcile/backoff/failed/429-abort/history/health); PKCE auth with
  state validation, Keystore-encrypted token, 7-day-skew refresh with transient/definitive split;
  SyncCoordinator trigger fabric (launch/foreground/network/120 s cadence/1.5 s debounce/manual,
  failed-requeue on the §9.5 set, foreground-only SSE with backoff + post-drop full sync);
  device identity; Account settings, quiet sync chip, sync history screen, account switch prompt,
  delete account, erase-everywhere (remote-first).
- **Live-verified without credentials:** OAuth bounce page client-agnostic (GET static forward,
  POST 302 promotion); auth-methods envelope + all three providers with PKCE material.

## Resuming From Here
- **Next:** Phase 6 — native surfaces (Glance widget, share target, app shortcuts, `gsd://`
  route hardening — the scheme + oauth-callback are registered; §6.4's task/quadrant/view routes
  are not yet). Then Phase 7 — Play readiness.
- **User smoke needed for Phase 5:** a real sign-in on a device (Google/Apple/GitHub) to exercise
  the Custom Tab → bounce → callback → exchange path and a two-device sync round-trip. Everything
  below the network is fixture-tested; the live hop needs real provider credentials.
- **Phase 5 deferrals:** onboarding's final-page sign-in buttons (Settings is the sign-in surface
  for now); expanded-width palette dialog styling; Chrome JS-redirect user-gesture caveat on the
  GET bounce path (fix is server-side 302 if it bites).
- **Still open (owner):** web-accessible account deletion URL for the Play Data Safety form.
